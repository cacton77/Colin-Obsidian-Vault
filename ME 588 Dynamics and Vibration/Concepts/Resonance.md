At specific frequencies of oscillation, a system can experience drastic vibration (called resonance), and catastrophic [[Fatigue Failure]] could follow.

Generally, designers want to avoid resonance in their systems, however it is also a phenomenon that can be harnessed for our advantage when we want to generate steady, large vibration.
