The first step in studying the vibration of a discrete system is to derive an equation of motion for the system. More often than not, the equation will be nonlinear. To simplify our solution we prescribe a treatment: to initially identify equilibrium positions and subsequently linearize the equation of motion around these positions.

Two methods exist for deriving the equation of motion: [[Newtonian]], and [[Lagrangian]].

# 1.1 Introduction to Vibration

**[[Vibration]] is an [[Oscillatory Motion]] around an [[Equilibrium Position]] of a system.**

To explain the concepts of [[Oscillatory Motion]] and [[Equilibrium Position]], consider the following example.
> ### Example 1.1
> Consider a pendulum in a gravitational field as shown in Fig. 1.1. The pendulum has a mass *m* and a massless, rigid link of length *l*. The motion of the pendulum is described via the angle *Î¸* between the link and the vertical downward direction. In these case, the pendulum has two equilibrium positions: one is downward vertical position ($\theta = 0^o$) and the other is upward vertical position ($\theta = 180^o$). When the pendulum is in the downward equilibrium position at $\theta = 0^o$ , a small disturbance (e.g., a small tap) will result in an oscillatory motion of the pendulum. When the pendulum is in the upward equilibrium position at $\theta = 180^o$ , a small disturbance will not lead to any oscillatory motion of the pendulum. Instead, the pendulum will drift away from the upward equilibrium position and move toward the downward equilibrium position.

The takeaways from this example:

1. A nonlinear system may have multiple equilibrium positions. (The equilibrium position may be located at infinity)[^1]
2. Small motion around an equilibrium position may or may not be oscillatory. When an oscillatory motion appears, it is considered to be [[Linear Oscillation]] if its amplitude is infinitesimal (i.e. small motion). In contrast, the oscillatory motion is considered to be [[Nonlinear Oscillation]], if its amplitude is finite (i.e. large motion).

### Why is vibration important? Why is it studied?
### [[Resonance]]:
At specific frequencies of oscillation, a system can experience drastic vibration (called resonance), and catastrophic fatigue failure could follow.

Generally, designers want to avoid resonance in their systems, however it is also a phenomenon that can be harnessed for our advantage when we want to generate steady, large vibration.
### [[Fatigue Failure]]:
Excessive vibration over time accumulates fatigue and leads to failure of structural and mechanical components. A designer can isolate a system from vibrations and thus reduce the liklihood of fatigue failure.

Figure 1.2: Free-Body diagram of the $i$-th particle

We now consider a discrete system with $N$ particles as shown in Fig. 1.2. Each particle, $i$, is governed by Newton's second law of motion:

$$m_i\ddot{\textbf{r}} = \textbf{F}^{(a)}_i + \textbf{F}^{(c)}_i, i = 1, 2, ..., N$$

where $m_i$ is the inertia of the $i$-th particle, $\textbf{r}_i$ is the position vector of the $i$-th particle, and the dots above $\textbf{r}_i$ denote time derivatives.

$\textbf{F}^{(a)}_i$ and $\textbf{F}^{(c)}_i$ refer to the [[Applied Forces]] and [[Constriant Forces]] acting on the $i$-th particle, respectively.

## [[Applied Forces]] $\textbf{F}^{(a)}_i$

Applied forces are external forces that are applied to a particle causing its subsequent motion. Three types of applied forces are often encountered in vibration problems.

### 1. *[[Restoring Forces]]*. 
A force which acts to bring a body to its [[Equilibrium Position]].

Common examples include:
- [[Spring Force]]: For a linear spring, the applied force $F$ is proportional to elongation $x$ via [[Hooke's Law]] ($F = kx$).
- [[Gravity]]: 

### 2. *[[Dissipative Forces]]*.
A force that causes a loss of energy.

- [[Massless Damper]]: For a linear damper (a.k.a. a viscous damper), the applied force $F$ is proportional to the rate of elongation $\dot{x}$, $F = c\dot{x}$.
- Aerodynamic Drag
- Friction

### 3. *[[Prescribed Forces]]*.
Forces applied to a discrete system in the form of a known amplitude and history.

Generally considered as known quantities in a vibration problem.

## [[Constraint Forces]] $\textbf{F}^{(c)}_i$
