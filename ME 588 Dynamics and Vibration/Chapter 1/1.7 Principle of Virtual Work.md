Figure 1.14: Illustration of virtual displacement

The following definitions make up the postulate of the principle of virtual work:

**1. A virtual displacement $\delta \textbf{r}$ is an *arbitrary*, *instantaneous*, and *infinitesimal* change of the position of a particle**.
- There is no physical meaning associated with virtual displacement. It is purely created to bypass constraint forces. This means you cannot relate it to physical displacement encountered in Newtonian mechanics.
- ***Arbitrary:*** Being arbitrary allows the virtual displacement to serve as an independent variable, thus you can use it to derive an equilibrium condition or an equation of motion.
- ***Instantaneous:*** Being instantaneous allows the virtual displacement to bypass the operation of time derivatives.
- ***Infinitesimal:*** Being infinitsimal allows many tools developed for calculus (e.g. finding differentials) to be used on virtual displacement.
- Looking at Fig. 1.14 will help us understand the concept of virtual displacement. In the figure, a particle is sliding down an inclined surface under the effect of gravity. The actual trajectory of the particle contains its current position at $t = t_0$, and another position at $t = t_0 + dt$ after the particle undergoes a displacement $d \textbf{r}$. This displacement is not arbitrary because it has to be tangential to the trajectory and its direction has already bee determined. It isn't instantaneous either because it needs two different instants for it to occur. It is only infinitesimal if the duration between the two instants is infinitesimal.
- Unlike $d \textbf{r}$, $\delta \textbf{r}$ is instantaneous because it is only defined at the instant $t = t_0$ and has nothign to do with the subsequent instant. Any infinitesimal change imposed on the position of the particle at this instant constitutes a virtual displacement.

**2. The virtual work $\delta W$ done by a force $\textbf{F}$ acting on a particle is the inner product of the force and the virtual displacement, i.e.,**
$$\delta W = \textbf{F} \cdot \delta \textbf{r} \tag{1.53}$$

**3. A virtual displacement is reversible if both $\delta \textbf{r}$ and $-\delta \textbf{r}$ are possible. Otherwise, it is irreversible.**

**4. A system of particles $m_i$, $i= 1,...,N,$ is said to be in equilibrium when the position vectors $\textbf{r}_i(t)$, $i=1, ..., N$, are constant**

**5. The total force acting on each and every particle of a mechanical system subjected to geometric constraints may be divided into two parts: the *applied* force (or impressed force) $\textbf{F}_i^{(a)}$ and the *workless constraint* force (force of reaction) $\textbf{F}_i^{(c)}$.**

### Fundamental Postulate:

The virtual work of the constraint forces is always zero for any (reversible) virtual displacement which is consistent with the kinematic constraints, and larger than zero for any irreversible virtual displacement (consistent with the kinematic constraints), i.e.,

> $$\sum_{i=1}^N \textbf{F}_i^{(c)} \cdot \delta \textbf{r}_i \geq 0 \tag{1.54}$$
> > greater than -> virtual displacement is irreversible
> > equal -> virtual displacement is reversible
