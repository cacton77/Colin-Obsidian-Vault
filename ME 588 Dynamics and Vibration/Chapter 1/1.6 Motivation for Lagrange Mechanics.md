# 1.6 Motivation for Lagrange Mechanics

**The Spirit of Lagrange Mechanics:** to derive the equations of motion without referring to constraint forces.

There are a number of steps to this process, and the mathematical tools used at each step of this process can be traced throughout history.

- 1686: Newton's second law of motion
- 1717: Principle of virtual work by Bernoulli
- 1743: D'Alembert's principle
- 1788: Lagrange's equation
- 1824: Hamilton's principle
