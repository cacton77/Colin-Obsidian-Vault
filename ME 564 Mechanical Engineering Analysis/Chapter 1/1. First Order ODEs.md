# First Order ODEs

An ordinary differential equation (ODE) contains:
- one or several derivatives of an unknown function $y(x)$ or $y(t)$.
- may contain y itself
- may contain constants

For example:
- 1st-order ODE: $y' = \cos{x}$
- 2nd-order ODE: $y'' + 9y = e^{-2x}$
- 3rd-order ODE: $y'y''' - \frac{3}{2}y'^2 = 0$

## First-order ODE Definitions
### [[Implicit Form]]
$$F(x, y, y') = 0$$
### [[Explicit Form]]
$$y' = f(x,y)$$
### [[General Solution]]
A solution containing an arbitrary constant $c$.
### [[Particular Solution]]
If a specific $c$ is chosen for a General Solution.
### [[Initial Condition]]
$y(x_0) = y_0$, gives a particular solution
### Initial Value Problem
ODE plus initial conditions

## Methods for Solving 1st order ODEs Analytically
- Separation of Variables
- Transform to separable form
- Exact ODEs, Integrating factors
- Solution of linear 1st order ODEs
- Bernoulli equations, reduction to linear form

## Separation of Variables
Some ODEs can be written in the form:
$$g(y)y' = f(x)$$
$$g(y)\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)$$
$$g(y)dy = f(x)dx$$
$$\int g(y)dy = \int f(x)dx + c$$
