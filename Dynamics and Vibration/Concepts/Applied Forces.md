Applied forces are external forces that are applied to a particle causing its subsequent motion. Three types of applied forces are often encountered in vibration problems.

### 1. *[[Restoring Forces]]*. 
A force which acts to bring a body to its [[Equilibrium Position]].

Common examples include:
- [[Spring Force]]: For a linear spring, the applied force $F$ is proportional to elongation $x$ via [[Hooke's Law]] ($F = kx$).
- [[Gravity]]: 

### 2. *[[Dissipative Forces]]*.
A force that causes a loss of energy.

- [[Massless Damper]]: For a linear damper (a.k.a. a viscous damper), the applied force $F$ is proportional to the rate of elongation $\dot{x}$, $F = c\dot{x}$.
- Aerodynamic Drag
- Friction

### 3. *[[Prescribed Forces]]*.
Forces applied to a discrete system in the form of a known amplitude and history.

Generally considered as known quantities in a vibration problem.
